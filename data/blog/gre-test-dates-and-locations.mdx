# How to Check GRE Test Dates and Locations for 2024

If you’re planning to take the **GRE (Graduate Record Examination)** in 2024, it’s essential to know the available test dates and locations well in advance. Choosing the right test date can help you prepare more effectively and avoid last-minute stress. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to check **GRE test dates and locations** to find the most convenient options for you.

## 1. Check Test Dates on the ETS Website

The **ETS website** is the official source for all GRE test dates and locations. To check the dates, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official **ETS GRE page** at [www.ets.org/gre](https://www.ets.org/gre).
2. Click on "Register" or "Test Centers and Dates."
3. Enter your preferred testing country and city to view the available test dates.

Once you’ve entered your location details, you’ll see a list of upcoming GRE test dates for both the **computer-based** and **paper-based** versions of the exam. It’s recommended to register early, especially if you’re planning to take the test during high-demand periods like the months before graduate school application deadlines.

## 2. How to Find GRE Test Locations

Once you’ve identified the test dates that fit your schedule, you’ll need to choose a test location that is convenient. ETS offers a wide range of test centers globally, and you can find the closest one by:

1. Returning to the **Test Centers and Dates** page on the ETS website.
2. Entering your city or postal code to get a list of nearby test centers.

Each test center will show the available dates for GRE testing, and you can compare locations based on convenience, availability, and capacity.

## 3. Considerations When Choosing a Test Date and Location

When choosing your GRE test date and location, consider the following factors:

- **Application Deadlines**: Make sure your test date aligns with the graduate school application deadlines. GRE scores are valid for five years, but many schools require recent scores (usually within two years).
- **Preparation Time**: Choose a test date that gives you ample time to study and take practice tests. Many students spend **3–6 months** preparing for the GRE.
- **Test Center Distance**: Select a test center that’s easy to reach on the test day. Test centers in major cities tend to fill up quickly, so early registration is key.

Planning ahead can help you avoid stress and give you the confidence to perform well on the test.

## 4. What to Do If Test Centers Are Fully Booked

In high-demand periods, you may find that nearby test centers are fully booked on your desired test dates. Here are a few options if that happens:

- **Look for Alternative Locations**: If your preferred test center is full, consider other nearby locations or check if there are later test dates available.
- **Consider a Paper-Based Test**: While most GRE tests are computer-based, ETS offers **paper-based tests** in locations where computer-based testing isn’t available. These tests are held on specific dates and might have more availability.
- **Plan for Rescheduling**: If necessary, ETS allows you to reschedule your GRE test up to 4 days before your scheduled test date (10 days for paper-based tests), but rescheduling fees may apply.

Always have a backup plan in place in case your first choice for test dates or locations isn’t available.
